    "This is an interactive course for learning the essentials of Crystallography. It covers several fundamental concepts, such as lattices, symmetry operations, and space groups (you'll learn what all of those mean soon), and comes equipped with an application (Ch. 7) that tells you the symmetry operations of any crystallographic file you choose to upload. The text follows the progression of Walter Borchardt-Ott's *Crystallography: An Introduction* (Third Edition). Along with text, this course uses images, questions, and interactive widgets to help you understand the information. "
