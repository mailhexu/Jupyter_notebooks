    "Lattices are a mathematical concept that is created by gathering all the permutations of basis vectors. One can look at a lattice as a tiling of some object. Lattices can exist in one, two, or three dimensions. To represent a lattice in n dimensions one needs n basis vectors. The basis vectors are often referred to as translational vectors. Lattices in 1D, 2D, and 3D are called line, plane, and, space lattices respectively. The following figures show a line lattice and a plane lattice represented by basis vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}(\\vec{b}\\nparallel\\vec{a})$."

    "A lattice is the best mathematical object to define a crystal structure. A crystal structure is created by combining a basis with a lattice. This means that the basis will be repeated in all of the points defining the lattice, creating periodic entities of the basis. In solid-state physics, we can use this concept to represent crystal structures. Using a suitable basis and lattice, we represent most of the crystal structures known to us. \n",
