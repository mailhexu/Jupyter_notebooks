    "A **point group** is the group of all of the mirror planes, rotation axes, and inversion centers of a crystal, i.e. the symmetry operations that leave at least one point unmoved. Different crystals that possess the same rotation, reflection, and inversion symmetries are said to belong to the same point group. "

    "In the previous chapter, we determined the space group of highest symmetry for a few of the Bravais lattices. We can easily find the point groups of highest symmetry for each crystal system by removing any translational symmetry, meaning we can also ignore the centerting type. These are listed for each crystal system in the table below, on the left half of the \"Point groups\" column."

Moving on to the monoclinic system, $2/m$ has the subgroups $m$, $2$, $\\overline{1}$, and $1$... but $\\overline{1}$ and $1$ belong to the triclinic system. If we continue this process until the cubic lattice, we will have identified all 32 unique point groups*."

    "This notation style is called the *International* or *Hermann-Mauguin* notation. Alternatively, point groups are often referred to by their *Schonflies* symbol, characterized by an uppercase letter with subscripted letters and numbers (e.g. $C_{2}$, $D_{6h}$). But unlike International symbols, Schonflies symbols are not useful for describing space groups. We won't give them much attention in this text, but if you do encounter them you can easily find tables online to translate between Schonflies and International. "
